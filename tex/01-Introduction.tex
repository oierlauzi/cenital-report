The vision mixer is the central element in a live \gls{tv} production facility. Its purpose is to switch among all the available video sources, such as cameras, media players, \glspl{cg}, etc. Therefore, it needs to operate in real-time, this is, it must be able to handle all the data on its inputs in a reasonable and invariant amount of time. Historically they have been discrete systems with highly specialized hardware, but advancements in computer technologies have led to the possibility of emulating them using software.\newline
