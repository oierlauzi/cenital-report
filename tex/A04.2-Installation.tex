As this is a web application, there is no need to install any piece of software. A publicly accessible instance is available at \url{https://oierlauzi.github.io/cenital-web-control/}. However, to modify and deploy a modified version, some additional steps must be carried out.\newline

\subsection{Development and deployment of the application}

The building process of the application is managed by \texttt{npm}. Therefore, this needs to be installed before proceding\footnote{\url{https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install}}. Once ready, go to the project directory (a folder named as \texttt{cenital-web-control} in the \texttt{src} directory) and install all the dependencies using the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    npm install
\end{lstlisting}

A development server may be started using the next command. This server is useful to rapidly prototype new features, but should not be used for real deployments.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    npm run serve
\end{lstlisting}

The last step is to deploy the website. This can be done using the following command, which outputs a standard website structure to the \texttt{dist} directory. These contents should be placed on a web server, which can be self-hosted or in the cloud.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    npm run build
\end{lstlisting}
